# Apaar's Budget & Brilliance Page

Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm a budget professional for a non-profit, and this site is a little space to showcase my passion for making every dollar count.

## About This Site

This simple webpage was created as a fun project to demonstrate:
-   Basic HTML for structure.
-   CSS for styling and design.
-   Hosting a static site using GitHub Pages.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
